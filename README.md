# Model_FootballPlayerData
For this project, I utilized the K-means clustering algorithm to model the data of football (or soccer) players across the Top 5 European leagues during the 2018-19 season. The goal is to determine general archetypes amongst professional players.

Please look through my notebook to observe my insights and visulization for this project.
